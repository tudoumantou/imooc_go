##Introduction
Skynet is a communication protocol for building massively distributed apps in Go.
It is not constrained to Go, so it will lend itself nicely to polyglot environments.
The first planned language addition is Ruby.

Skynet is currently undergoing a large refactoring. What's represented here used to exist under the skynet2 repo, and leverages zookeeper. We are currently refactoring to use the new SkyDNS and HTTP/JSON. This readme as well as extensive documentation will be released when the refactoring is completed.
